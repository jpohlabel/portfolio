# Football Game
2021-2024

## Background
This was a college football video game I spent a couple years developing as a personal project. I was the head developer on this project and did roughly 90%-95% of the work, and I worked with two other developer friends (one a 3D modeler, another a graphic designer). 
I did all of the programming on the project and also contributed in other areas. I started this project as a fun hobby to do with friends, but it grew to have a community of about a thousand players, and I sold off some assets from the game for roughly $5000 total over the years.
The community is still running to this day, although I am not involved anymore.

## Description
In this game, players can create a character and choose from several different real-life colleges. They can choose their name, number, and customize their helmets/jerseys/accessories. They can then travel around the country to different stadiums and play games.
The gameplay has realistic physics, tackling, throwing, kicking, and more. There is a realistic scoreboard graphic displaying the team names, scores, and time as you would see on TV. Games can be played at different times of day and in different weather conditions (rain, snow, etc.). 
Teams can choose from several different helmet/jersey combinations, and the jerseys are fairly accurate to how they look in real life.

## Technical Info
The game was written in the Lua scripting language (similar to Python) on the ROBLOX platform. I know ROBLOX is stereotypically thought of as a kids game, but it has actually become quite advanced in recent years and you can do a lot on it. 
It is more of a game development platform than an actual game. It is also what I first learned to code on back in middle school, so I had enough experience on it to make something fairly quickly. 

This game was made from scratch. I had to set up a module loader system to allow modules to communicate with each other and avoid circular dependencies, since ROBLOX is not set up for this. I had full-stack development experience here, from loading player data on the backend,
networking to the client, and displaying UIs. I also got experience with 3D modeling and graphics software (Blender, Inkscape, paint.net - free softwares but you can do a lot with them). 

I am available to go through the code upon request. This was my most extensive project and I am proud to show it off and explain how it works.
