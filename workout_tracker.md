# Workout Tracker
2023

## Background
This project was for a senior year mobile app development class. I worked with one other student on this project.

## Description
We created an app that allowed you to track your workouts. You could create an account, take a profile picture with the phone camera, and then create workout routines
with different exercises, weights, sets, and reps. Then, you could start a workout following one of your routines. It would tell you what to do, and you would input what
weight you actually did and for how many sets/reps. It would also time your workout. Then, you can look at all of your previously completed workouts to see how you progress
over time.

## Technical Info
We created this app using Flutter, which allows you to compile dart code to work on both Android and iOS devices. We used FlutterFire which is Flutter's integration with Firebase
to allow for user authentication and saving of data. This app used a Model-View-View Model (MVVM) architecture, similar to a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. We also 
utilized unit tests in the creation of this app.
