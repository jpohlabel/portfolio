# Legend of Zelda
2022

## Background
This was for a junior year project course. I worked with 4 other students to recreate the first dungeon in 1986's The Legend of Zelda.
We also had the chance to add additional features of our own choosing as part of the final sprint.

## Description
This was a top-down 2D game in which the player (Link) had to advance through a dungeon. You have to go through several rooms and face smaller enemies, collecting items and keys
as you go. There are a few puzzles throughout, such as being able to blow up walls or push secret blocks. You can also unlock new weapons. If you make it far enough without dying, 
you find the final boss, a dragon that breathes fireballs at you. If you can defeat the dragon, you win, otherwise you have to restart. 
For our additional features, we added a second level, local multiplayer, and xbox achievements (for laughs).

## Technical Info
We wrote this game in C# using the MonoGame engine. For many students, this class was a first look at designing a large interactive system from scratch
and gave a chance to apply principles such as OOP, encapsulation, loose coupling, factories, interfaces, classes, abstract and virtual classes, git, state machines, and more.
I also did a lot of image editing in paint.net on this project.
