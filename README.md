# Jacob Pohlabel's Portfolio
These are some of my personal and school projects spanning several years. I am not providing code publicly as several of these projects were done in academic environments, but I can do so privately upon request. 
I am also open to demoing these projects over a video call. Please feel free to contact me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-pohlabel/

All of the projects are listen in their own separate markdown files. Click on a file for more info about a project. Alternatively, click here:
